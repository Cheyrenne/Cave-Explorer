Resources used:

1.	Link : http://programarcadegames.com/python_examples/show_file.php?file=move_with_walls_example.py

	This link is to a video tutorial and code about how to detect collisions with your
	player sprite in pygame. I modified the collision code to include gravity in my 	version.

2.	Platformer with Spritesheets
	
    	Link: http://programarcadegames.com/python_examples/sprite_sheets/

	I used this to learn how to go about making and laying out file/class structures for a platformer from scratch. 

3. 	OpenGameArt
	Link: opengameart.org

	This site has lots of public domain artwork. All of the art for the game came from the site.
	For the 2nd and 3rd level, most of the art came from the PlatformerArt Pack from the 
	submitter Kenney. They can be found by searching "Kenney" in submitter field.
